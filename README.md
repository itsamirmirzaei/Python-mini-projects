# Yo, what's up? 
THis repo's got a bunch of small Python projects I whipped up for practice and learning.


## Projects
- Number Guessing Game: A fun little game where you try to guess a random number.
- Rock Paper Scissors: The classic game to settle any argument, coded in Python!


## How to Run
To get these projects bruning, make sure you've got Python 3.8 or higher installed. Then, hop into the project's folder and run:
``bash
python NumberGuesser.py
