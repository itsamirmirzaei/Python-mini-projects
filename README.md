# Yo, what's up? 
THis repo's got a bunch of small Python projects I whipped up for practice and learning.


## Projects
- [Number Guessing Name](BitByBite/GuessNumber/NumberGuesser.py): A fun little game where you try to guess a random number.

- [Rock Paper Scissors](BitByBite/RockPaperScissors/RockPaperScissors.py): The classic game to settle any argument, coded in Python.


## How to Run
To get these projectsbruning, make sure you've got Python 3.8 or higher installed. Then, hop into the project's folder and run:
```bash
python NumberGuesser.py
python RockPaperScissors.py
