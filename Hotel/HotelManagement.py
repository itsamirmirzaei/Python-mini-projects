# Moon Roadside Hotel Management System.
# This program simulates a roadside hotel management system where the hotel owner
# interacts with guests upon arrival, asks dynamic questions, and assigns rooms. The
# system is designed to create a friendly and engaging experience for users through
# interactive conversations, including short stories, emotion detection, humorous
# responses, and follow-up questions based on guest answers.
